	<h1>Vue introduction by Christopher Erickson</h1>
	<p>The following is my attempt to figure out vue.js for the first time. The following is utilizing the message to make the following text reactive.</p>
	<h2>Go into the console and type app.message = "your text here" to change the text.</h2>
  <div id="app">
    {{ message }}
  </div>
  <h2>The following is using attributes that vue calls directives. In paticular it is using v-bind to make the title of the div reactive. When you see attributes with a v- in the front that means it is provided by vue. </h2>
  <div id="bnd">
  <span v-bind:title="message">
    Hover your mouse over me for a few seconds
    to see my dynamically bound title!
  </span>
</div>
<h2>Vue can also effect the structure of the document in addition to the text and attributes. enter hidz.seen = false to make the following text dissapear.</h2>
<div id="hidz">
  <span v-if="seen">Poof!!</span>
</div>

  <script>
    var app = new Vue({
      el: '#app',
      data: {
        message: 'Hello Vue!'
      }
    })
	var bnd = new Vue({
  el: '#bnd',
  data: {
    message: 'You loaded this page on ' + new Date().toLocaleString()
  }
})
var hidz = new Vue({
  el: '#hidz',
  data: {
    seen: true
  }
})
  </script>
